# Rich Documentation
documentation:
  overview: |
    This skill provides structured YouTube video analysis using transcript extraction
    and AI-powered segmentation. It transforms long-form video content into organized,
    timestamped knowledge sections suitable for study, indexing, research, and
    documentation workflows.

    Built on the Agno framework with OpenRouter for language model reasoning
    and optional Mem0 for session memory.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Summarizing educational videos"
      - "Creating study guides from lectures"
      - "Breaking down programming tutorials"
      - "Extracting procedural steps from demonstrations"
      - "Generating timestamped chapter breakdowns"
      - "Indexing long-form video content for searchability"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Live stream monitoring"
      - "Video editing or manipulation"
      - "Visual recognition or object detection"
      - "Private or restricted videos"
      - "Mass content downloading or archival"
      - "Videos without available transcripts"

  input_structure: |
    Accepts YouTube URLs or structured JSON input.

    Example (Plain Text):
    "Analyze this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g"

    Example (JSON):
    {
